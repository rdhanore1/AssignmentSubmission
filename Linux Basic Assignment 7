7. Working with Environment Variables
Use export to set a new environment variable called MY_VAR with the value "Hello, Linux!".

Answer:
# 1. Set a new environment variable called MY_VAR with the value "Hello, Linux!"
export MY_VAR="Hello, Linux!"

# 2. Verify that the environment variable is set
echo $MY_VAR

# 3. To make the environment variable persistent across sessions, add it to ~/.bashrc
echo 'export MY_VAR="Hello, Linux!"' >> ~/.bashrc

# 4. Reload ~/.bashrc to apply the changes
source ~/.bashrc

# 5. Verify again that the environment variable is set
echo $MY_VAR

# The final output should display "Hello, Linux!" twice, confirming that MY_VAR is set correctly
