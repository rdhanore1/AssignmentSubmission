Answer:
# 1. Search for lines containing the word "root" in /etc/passwd
grep "root" /etc/passwd

# 2. Count the number of lines containing the word "root"
grep -c "root" /etc/passwd

# 3. Search for lines containing the word "root" and display line numbers
grep -n "root" /etc/passwd

# 4. Search for lines containing the word "root" in a case-insensitive manner
grep -i "root" /etc/passwd

# 5. Search for lines containing the word "root" and display 2 lines of context before and after each match
grep -C 2 "root" /etc/passwd

# The final output should display all lines containing the word "root" along with the additional requested information
