6. Changing Permissions
Create a file named secure.txt and change its permissions to read-only for everyone using chmod.

Answer:
# 1. Create a file named secure.txt
touch secure.txt

# 2. Change its permissions to read-only for everyone
chmod 444 secure.txt

# 3. Verify the permissions
ls -l secure.txt

# The output should show -r--r--r-- indicating read-only permissions for user, group, and others

# 4. Attempt to write to the file (this should fail)
echo "Trying to write to secure.txt" >> secure.txt || echo "Write operation failed as expected"

# 5. Clean up by removing the file
rm secure.txt

# 6. Verify that the file has been removed
ls -l secure.txt || echo "secure.txt has been removed"

# The final output should confirm that secure.txt has been removed
